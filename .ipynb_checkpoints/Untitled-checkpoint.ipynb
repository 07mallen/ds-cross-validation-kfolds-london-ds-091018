    "# Cross Validation\n",
    "We've looked at a range of topics involved with fitting a model to data. This began with the simplest of regression cases and determining criteria for an optimal model, which led us to mean squarred error. From there, we further examined overfitting and underfitting which motivated train test split and later, the bias variance tradeoff. Here, we synthesize many of these ideas into a new sampling, optimization meta-routine known as cross validation. \n",
    "\n",
    "A common form of cross validation is known as K-folds. In this process, the dataset is partitioned into K equally sized groups. Each group is then used as a hold out test set while the remaining k-1 groups are used as a training set. This then produces K different models, one for each of the hold out test sets. These models can then be averaged (perhaps a weighted average based on their test set performance) in order to produce a finalized model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also a very useful method for helping to determine the generalization of our models, or the anticipated difference between train and test errors for the model."
